# Session signaling

Lets assume two Wireguard peers `Pa` & `Pb` are seeking to establish a ICE session.

The smaller public key (PK) of the two peers takes the role of the controlling agent.
In this example PA has the role of the controlling agent as: `PK(PA) < PK(PB)`.

```text
PA                         PB

  --- initial offer     -->        id=SID_Pa, version=0, candidates=[], eoc=false
  <-- initial offer     ---        id=SID_Pb, version=0, candidates=[], eoc=false

  --- subsequent offers -->        id=SID_Pa, version=1, candidates=[C1_Pa], eoc=false
  <-- subsequent offers ---        id=SID_Pb, version=1, candidates=[C1_Pb], eoc=false

  --- subsequent offers -->        id=SID_Pa, version=2, candidates=[C1_Pa, C2_Pa], eoc=false
  <-- subsequent offers ---        id=SID_Pb, version=2, candidates=[C1_Pb, C2_Pb], eoc=false

  ---  eoc. offer       -->        id=SID_Pa, version=3, candidates=[C1_Pa, C2_Pa], eoc=true
  <--  eoc. offer       ---        id=SID_Pb, version=3, candidates=[C1_Pb, C2_Pb], eoc=true
```

## Restart

Agent will restart

-   if
    -   `last_recv.id` has been set
    -   `recv.id!=last_recv.id`
    -   `recv.version==0`

-   then
    -   set
        -   `local.id=rand()`
        -   `local.version=0`
        -   `local.candidates=[]`

    -   publish new offer

    -   wait for first offer including candidates from remote

    -   (re)start agent

    -   add first received

    -   start gathering candidates
        -   send an offers for each candidate `c`:
            -   `candidates=local.candidates.append(c)`
            -   `id=local.id`
            -   `rid=local.rid`
            -   `version=local.version++`

## Offer

Offers are exchanged by one or more the signaling backends via Protobuf messages.

Checkout the [`pkg/pb/offer.proto`](../pkg/pb/offer.proto) for details.

## Backends

É¯ice can support multiple backends for signaling session information such as session IDs, ICE candidates, public keys and STUN credentials.

### Available backends

Currently, the main backend is based on [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/).
For the use within a Kubernetes cluster also a dedicated backend using the Kubernetes api-server is available.
Checkout the [`Backend`](../pkg/signaling/backend.go) interface for implementing your own backend.
