.SH NAME
.PP
cunicu-relay - Start relay API server


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcunicu relay URL... [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command starts a gRPC server providing cunicu agents with a list of available STUN and TURN servers.

.PP
\fBNote:\fP Currently this command does not run a TURN server itself. But relies on an external server like Coturn.

.PP
With this feature you can distribute a list of available STUN/TURN servers easily to a fleet of agents.
It also allows to issue short-lived HMAC-SHA1 credentials based the proposed TURN REST API and thereby static long term credentials.

.PP
The command expects a list of STUN or TURN URLs according to RFC7065/RFC7064 with a few extensions:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
A secret for the TURN REST API can be provided by the 'secret' query parameter
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Example: turn:server.com?secret=rest-api-secret

.RE

.IP \(bu 2
A time-to-live to the TURN REST API secrets can be provided by the 'ttl' query parameter
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Example: turn:server.com?ttl=1h

.RE

.IP \(bu 2
Static TURN credentials can be provided by the URIs user info
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Example: turn:user1:pass1@server.com
